# Neural Network from Scratch!
Created a Neural Network without tensorflow/pytorch using MNSIT dataset to predict handwritten digits. <br />
Dataset has not been uploaded in the given repository. <br />
The same can be downloaded from:https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data <br />
Make sure to place the digit-recognizer folder in the same as that of your project and you are good to go!<br />
